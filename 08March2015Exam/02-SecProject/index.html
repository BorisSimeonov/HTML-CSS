                    There are two different versions of the
                    Orion myth, depending on the identity of
                    his parents. The first of these identifies
                    the sea-god Neptune as Orion's father and the
                    the great huntress Queen Euryale of the Amazons
                    as his mother. Orion inherited her talent, and
                    became the greatest hunter in the world. Unfortunately
                    for him, with his immense strength came an immense ego,
                    and he boasted that he could best any animal on earth.
                    In response to his vanity, a single small scorpion stung
                    him and killed him.

                    Another version of the Orion myth states that he had no
                    mother but was a gift to a pious peasant from Jupiter,
                    Neptune, and Mercury. <span>"Orion supposedly was able to walk on
                    water and had greater strength and stature than any other mortal.
                    A skilled blacksmith, he fabricated a subterranean palace for Vulcan.
                    He also walled in the coasts of Sicily against the encroaching
                    sea and built a temple to the gods there" (Magee, 48).</span>
